# GCP_tutorial
As cloud computing is more and more important in current software deployment, there are some big Cloud provider, **GCP** is one of them. This repository contains some notebooks to explain how to use **GCP** products for tutorial, as there are many products I just focus on some could be explained by **code** or **command line**. Also I have added as more clear comments as possible try to add my understanding.
