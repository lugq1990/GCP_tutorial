# GCP tutorial
As cloud computing is more and more important in current software development, there are some big Cloud provider, **GCP** is one of them. This repository contains some notebooks to explain how to use **GCP** products with **Python**, as there are many products I just focus on some could be explained by **code** or **command line**. Also I have added some comments to add my understanding and tips.

  ### TODOS:
  There are many to be added.

Learning is not one day work, but a continious process, I would try to add as more as possible tutorials about **GCP** during my learning path. 

Love to hear suggestions, hope you will learn something from here.
