That's main use case of pubsub. \n","\n","In fact, for publisher and subsriber, there are many relationships: one-many, many-many, many-one, you could get some high level understanding of different relationship.![Different relationship](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/images/many-to-many.svg)\n","\n","In image to show is just like this(this is one publisher and two subscribers.):\n","\n","![publisher and subscriber](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/images/qs-diag-final.svg)\n","\n","Let's to use GCP to demonstrate how to use PUBSUB in
